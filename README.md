# Ray's Prework-Study-Guide Website


## Description

Hi all I'm Ray and this is my study guide! I was motivated to create this study guide because it was homework!! Haha just kidding, actually my motivation is the same as my reason for taking this coding bootcamp. I took this bootcamp and indeed made this study guide to further some of my major lifelong goals which are longterm financial stability and the freedom to travel the world! This study guide is just one more step along along that long path that is self improvement and it helped me learn alot while doing it. I can't wait to continue updating and resolving issues with it as I learn and grow as a coder.

This is a Study Guide...For studying!!

...You should study with it

Haha just kidding, sort of :)


This study guide covers what I've learned of "HTML, CSS JavaScript and Git". My notes on each are under their respective headings and if you open the DevTools console you can see the JavaScript running, it will even suggest you a new topic to study each time you load it!
